Hello !! Welcome to my really ridiculous github profile! 
*Check the links in my profile for info about me since you stopped by.* (This is for pony town purposes ONLY, I am not referring to any other games)

**Interact**
- Kpop fans , *boynextdoor, txt, etc*
- very friendly / funny people
- all of us are dead
- squid game
- the amazing world of gumball (jokingly)
- DC , MARVEL (I don't know much but why not)
- literally anything of my interests in my links!!

**Do not interact**
- Basic dni criteria
- Being mean to me and/or my friends, seriously why (instant block, or not for fun)
- Copied skin from me, friends, family, or pinterest (excluding tutorials)

C+h is fine always, I don't mind at all! Interacting, being my friend is also a good thing. Please jsut don't copy my skins, little inspo is okay but I don't wanna see somebody with my hard work ðŸ’”
