**âš WARNINGâš ** (1) Please do not mention anything about crushes (aka the person you like or someone likes), I'm just saying because I was in a group who would talk about it all day (they would change their crushes constantly), and it kind of goes to the point they are stalkers, any minimum info abt anyones crush is okay but I really don't wanna remeber of what happened in my group. (I also especially don't want to talk about it at all if anyone is sensitive to anything related). Excluding any fictional character (it can also be kpop idols, actors, etc)

(2) I do not want to be in another group or any kind of gang, I am fine with only 1 or 2 and never anything more. I don't want to have to try keeping our friendships balanced, since ive already been through it many times and it really gets me (because it can lead to very bad things).

(3) PLEASE just don't tell me to tell you a secret, seriously I don't trust anyone. At all, I only trust one person (my 1&only), but if I just tell you a secret anyway, it means I trust you really (but really not anyone)

(4) I don't wanna make people feel left out or something like that, so I make myself minimum friend requests.

(5) If I really decided to join a group anyone added me in, I will just TRY to keep stable friendships with all, I will try to be the same with others and try to not trigger anyone or anything.

(6) I am super bad at keeping friendships stable so I wouldnt really recommend interacting with me (Its also why I have limited friends).

(7) I'm sorry if I can be cold/dry sometimes, I'm really pressured or I just really dont have the mood.
